# Google Trends data
## Script for collecting a Google Trends monthly, weekly and daily for any keywords (here it is "Bitcoin") since any date till the current day.
The task is to get the google search trend data for any keywords, for instance, Bitcoin keyword. I was not familiar with how to do it and neither I have work on similar task. So, I have googled it and looked few videos and came to know about the python library pytrends. Initially it was not working for me when I was changing the year, and I spend about 2 hours to debug that and look for various information on google. I have also tried to look for any other alternate library but I didn't liked most of them. May be because I was looking for python library, and there is another good library in R may be better than this. Then after more research and debugging the pytrend library for around a hour and half, I have saw it working with the different range of date, and giving the data according to the range of data. At the same moment the idea came up in mind and wrote the code and tested it. The idea is simple to use the while loop to break the time in different segments to get the different time. With the approach, various trials and the result achieved, I settled on this idea.
